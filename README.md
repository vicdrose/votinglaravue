# votinglaravue
A Laravel voting app, similar to a Quora or a Stack Overflow, used to create a system for users (question askers) to engage with other people knowledgable in that subject.

There are 3 main functions here: Questions, Answers, along with Voting.

votinglaravue/app/Http/Controllers/ <-- Controllers are here

votinglaravue/routes/api.php <-- Routes are here

votinglaravue/resources/views <-- Blade template files are here 

votinglaravue/resources/js <-- Vue.js components are here
